# Active-Debris-Removal
Master Project on Active Derbis Removal - The Uninvited Group

DecayOptimization.m : calculate the optimal foam ball radius to deorbit the given debris in 25 years using the DecayTime function.*

Orbiter3D.m : Integrates motion equations (in 3D and coded into Steer, HopperNoTurn, Orbiter, Thrust functions depending on fligth status) using ODE45 function.



Thanks to the earth plot from Ryan Gray adapted for the purpose of this project.
