# Active-Debris-Removal
Master Project on Active Derbis Removal - The Uninvited Group

Decay_Optimization.m : calculate the optimal foam ball radius to deorbit the given debris in 25 years using the DecayTime function.*

GravityTurn3D.m : Integrates motion equations (in 3D and coded into Steer, Hopper_NoTurn, Orbiter3D, Prograde_Burn functions depending on fligth status) using ODE45 function.
